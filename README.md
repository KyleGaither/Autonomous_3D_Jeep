The Autonomous 3D Jeep project is a fully 3D Printed 1/8th scale 2 door Jeep Using [3DSets.com](www.3dsets.com) Rancher hardtop design files. This project is meant to satisfy an Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Senior Project. The goal is to print the Jeep out of an engineering grade material (MatterHackers NylonX) then fit Appropriate hardware to enable autonomous driving capabilities.
